# Database Design Decisions - Interview Prep Platform

## Overview
This document outlines the key design decisions made for the Interview Prep Platform database schema, focusing on PostgreSQL with Supabase integration.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Database Technology Choice
**Decision:** PostgreSQL with Supabase  
**Rationale:** 
- Native support for complex data types (JSONB, arrays)
- Excellent performance with proper indexing
- Supabase provides built-in authentication and Row Level Security
- Real-time subscriptions for live features
- Easy integration with Next.js/React applications

### 2. Authentication Strategy
**Decision:** Extend Supabase auth.users with custom users table  
**Rationale:**
- Leverage Supabase's battle-tested auth system
- Support multiple providers (Google OAuth, email/password)
- Maintain referential integrity with our custom data
- Enable easy user management and security policies

**Implementation:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.users (
    id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
    -- Extended fields here
);
```

### 3. User Profiles Separation
**Decision:** Separate `users` and `user_profiles` tables  
**Rationale:**
- Core authentication data vs extended profile information
- Cleaner data organization and easier maintenance
- Allows for optional profile completion
- Better query performance for auth-only operations

### 4. Subscription Management
**Decision:** Flexible subscription system with trial support  
**Rationale:**
- Support multiple billing cycles (weekly $9, monthly $29)
- Built-in free trial functionality (7 days)
- Stripe integration ready with customer/subscription ID fields
- Easy plan feature management using JSONB

**Key Features:**
- Trial period tracking
- Subscription status management
- Plan feature flags in JSONB format
- Usage limits per plan

### 5. Question Caching Strategy
**Decision:** Comprehensive question caching with usage tracking  
**Rationale:**
- Reduce AI API costs by reusing quality questions
- Track question performance with usage_count and rating
- Enable smart question selection based on user feedback
- Support multiple question types and difficulty levels

**Caching Benefits:**
- Usage-based optimization (popular questions get priority)
- Quality scoring (user ratings improve selection)
- Cost efficiency (fewer AI API calls)
- Faster response times

### 6. Analytics and Progress Tracking
**Decision:** Dual-layer analytics with user progress and platform metrics  
**Rationale:**
- `user_progress` table for individual user analytics
- `analytics_daily` table for platform-wide insights
- Flexible metric storage using name-value pairs
- JSONB for complex metric data

### 7. Data Relationships and Constraints
**Decision:** Strong referential integrity with cascading deletes  
**Rationale:**
- Ensure data consistency across all tables
- Automatic cleanup when users are deleted
- Prevent orphaned records
- Clear ownership hierarchy

### 8. Indexing Strategy
**Decision:** Comprehensive indexing for all query patterns  
**Rationale:**
- Fast user lookups by email and provider
- Efficient session and response queries
- GIN indexes for array fields (skills, tags)
- Time-based indexes for analytics queries

**Key Indexes:**
```sql
-- User lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_provider ON users(provider, provider_id);

-- Question optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_usage_count ON questions(usage_count DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_tags ON questions USING GIN(tags);

-- Performance queries
CREATE INDEX idx_practice_sessions_started_at ON practice_sessions(started_at DESC);
```

### 9. Row Level Security (RLS)
**Decision:** Comprehensive RLS policies on all user data  
**Rationale:**
- Supabase best practices for security
- Automatic data isolation between users
- Protection against data leaks
- Client-side queries are automatically filtered

**Security Patterns:**
```sql
-- Users can only see their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON users 
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Public data is readable by authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Questions are publicly readable" ON questions 
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);
```

### 10. Data Types and Storage Efficiency
**Decision:** Optimized data types for storage and performance  
**Rationale:**

**Text Arrays:** Used for skills, tags, strengths, improvements
- Better than separate junction tables for simple lists
- Efficient storage and querying with GIN indexes
- Easy to work with in application code

**JSONB:** Used for flexible data like features, metadata, evaluation criteria
- Schema flexibility for evolving requirements
- Efficient querying and indexing
- Native PostgreSQL support

**UUID:** Used for all primary keys
- Better distribution for sharding
- No sequence conflicts in distributed systems
- Supabase standard practice

### 11. Question Management System
**Decision:** Smart question caching with metadata tracking  
**Components:**
- **Categories:** Behavioral, Technical, Situational, etc.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Experience Targeting:** Entry to Executive levels
- **Usage Analytics:** Track popularity and effectiveness

**Benefits:**
- Intelligent question selection
- Continuous quality improvement
- Cost optimization through reuse
- Performance tracking

### 12. Session and Response Tracking
**Decision:** Detailed session management with AI feedback integration  
**Features:**
- Session types: Quick, Full, Custom, Mock Interview
- Real-time progress tracking
- AI-powered scoring and feedback
- Voice response support (audio URLs)
- Performance analytics

### 13. Achievement System
**Decision:** Flexible achievement tracking for user engagement  
**Implementation:**
- Unique achievement types per user
- Flexible metadata storage in JSONB
- Easy to extend with new achievement types
- Tracks engagement milestones

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Query Optimization
- Strategic indexing on all common query patterns
- Composite indexes for multi-column queries
- GIN indexes for array and JSONB fields

### 2. Caching Strategy
- Question caching reduces API costs
- Usage tracking enables smart selection
- Popular questions get priority

### 3. Data Partitioning (Future)
- Analytics tables can be partitioned by date
- User data can be partitioned by registration date
- Response data can be partitioned by creation date

## Scalability Considerations

### 1. Read Replicas
- Analytics queries can use read replicas
- Question serving can use read replicas
- User data requires primary database

### 2. Horizontal Scaling
- UUID primary keys support sharding
- User-centric data model enables easy partitioning
- Session data can be archived periodically

### 3. Caching Layers
- Question cache reduces database load
- User session data can be cached
- Analytics can use materialized views

## Security Measures

### 1. Row Level Security
- All user data protected by RLS
- Automatic data isolation
- No server-side authorization logic needed

### 2. Data Encryption
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Payment information handled by Stripe
- Personal data minimization

### 3. Audit Trail
- All tables include created_at/updated_at
- User actions tracked through sessions
- Subscription changes logged

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Real-time Features
- Live practice sessions with peers
- Real-time progress updates
- Chat functionality for mock interviews

### 2. Advanced Analytics
- ML-based question recommendations
- Performance trend analysis
- Comparative analytics

### 3. Content Management
- Admin interface for question management
- Content moderation workflows
- Question quality scoring algorithms

## Migration Strategy

The database schema is implemented through 7 sequential migrations:
1. Extensions and utilities
2. User management
3. Subscription system
4. Question management
5. Session tracking
6. Analytics system
7. Views and functions

Each migration is atomic and can be safely rolled back if needed.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Performance Monitoring
- Index usage tracking
- Slow query identification
- Connection pool monitoring

### 2. Data Cleanup
- Automated archival of old sessions
- Question cache optimization
- Analytics data aggregation

### 3. Backup Strategy
- Daily automated backups
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Cross-region backup storage
